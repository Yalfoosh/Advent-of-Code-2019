# Advent of Code 2019 - Python


# Requirements

This was run with Python 3.7.5, but can probably be run with 3.6 as well. From the newer features, I mostly only use type hints, which should be fully supported in Python 3.6.

Aside from the Python version requirements, I'll probably use things like

 - re
 - numpy
 - itertools
 
So make sure those are usable
